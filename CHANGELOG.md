## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.5.2] - 2022-03-01

### Changed

- Fixed an error where `burn_in_period` was not being assigned in `RotateOnly`.
- Added `RotateOnly` to the working example.

## [0.1.5.1] - 2022-02-13

### Added

- Working toy example (folder `example`).

### Changed

- Fixed small bugs in RotoGrad (attribute names and properties inheritance).

## [0.1.5] - 2021-12-17

### Added

- Introduced RotateOnly class. This is equivalent to the RotoGrad class of version 0.1.4.
- Added `backbone_loss` argument to backward to allow for backbone-specific losses.

### Changed

- Updated VanillaMTL to have the same methods as RotoGrad class.
- Modified RotoGrad so that it also scales the gradients as described in the updated version of the paper.
- Enabled gradient computation when computing the normalizing factor of RotoGradNorm.
  
## [0.1.4] - 2021-03-31

### Changed

- RotoGrad no longer normalizes the losses by default (now it is only performed
  internally to compute GradNorm's weights). We keep the option to still normalize them 
  if desired.
